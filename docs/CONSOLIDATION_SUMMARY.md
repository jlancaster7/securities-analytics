   - Included market data technical details
   - Added best practices section
   - Common issues and solutions

3. **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** (Unchanged)

### Archived Documents (in docs/archive/)
- REPOSITORY_OVERVIEW.md (original version preserved)
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (historical record)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FIX_TO_FLOAT.md (completed work)
- FIX_TO_FLOAT_DOCUMENTATION.md (merged into TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md)
- CALLABLE_FIX_TO_FLOAT_GUIDE.md (merged into TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate content across files
2. **Clearer Navigation**: Each document has a specific purpose
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer files to keep updated
4. **Better Organization**: Historical docs preserved but separated
5. **Improved Onboarding**: New users have clear starting point

## Document Purposes

- **README.md**: First stop for anyone new to the project
- **TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md**: Deep dive for developers implementing features
- **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Specific instructions for work data integration
- **ROADMAP.md**: Future planning and team coordination
